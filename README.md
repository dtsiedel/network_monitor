Run with

`lein figwheel`

Figwheel will automatically push cljs changes to the browser. The server will
be available at [http://localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449) once Figwheel
starts up. 

Or run without pushing changes: 

`lein do clean, run`

The application will then be available at
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
